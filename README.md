This mod adds a button, slider, and a text box that allows users to multiply the power of most planes on Geo-fs.

For using it in Tampermonkey simply create a new Tampermonkey script, and replace everything in it with the code from Tampermonkey Script. You can also just paste it in the console if you don't have Tampermonkey.

For using it as a bookmarklet create a new bookmark and replace the url with the code from Bookmarklet Script. Bookmarklets don't work with Edge.

I've only tested using Tampermonkey on Chrome, and i've gotten reports that it doesn't work on Edge, but pasting it into the console should work.
