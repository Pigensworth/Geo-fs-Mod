#### This mod adds two "secret" skins and some power options for most planes on Geo-fs.

# Disclaimer!
I'm not responsible for any damage caused by this script, including but not limited to being banned. I haven't gotten banned, but just in case. If you try to go to fast then the plane will start jumping around and could crash the page.

# Tampermonkey
For using it in Tampermonkey simply create a new Tampermonkey script, and replace everything in it with the code in Tampermonkey.js. You can also just paste it in the console if you don't have Tampermonkey.

# Bookmarklet
For using it as a bookmarklet create a new bookmark, replace the url with the code in Bookmarklet.js, and name it Geo-fs-Speed-Mod (I'm not sure if it has to have a certain name, but this works for me). Bookmarklets don't work with Edge.

# Use
Once it's loaded you can click the Power Options button then simply move the slider to the desired value and hit Multiply Power button to do exactly that (or the Divide Power button if you're one of those people.)

I've only tested using Tampermonkey on Chrome, and I've gotten reports that it goes wild on Edge, but pasting it into the console worked for me.

If you're using it and see me on there then (if you don't mind) let me know that you're using it!
