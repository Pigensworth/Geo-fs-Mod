This mod adds a button, slider, and a text box that allows users to multiply the power of most planes on Geo-fs.

Disclaimer! I'm not responsible for any damage caused by this script, including but not limited to being banned. I haven't gotten banned, but just in case. If you try to go to fast then the plane will start jumping around and could crash the page.


For using it in Tampermonkey simply create a new Tampermonkey script, and replace everything in it with the code in Tampermonkey.js. You can also just paste it in the console if you don't have Tampermonkey.

For using it as a bookmarklet create a new bookmark, replace the url with the code in Bookmarklet.js, and name it Geo-fs-Speed-Mod (I'm not sure if it has to have a certain name, but this works for me). Bookmarklets don't work with Edge.

Once it's loaded simply move the slider to the desired value and hit the button to multiply it by that.

I've only tested using Tampermonkey on Chrome, and I've gotten reports that it doesn't work on Edge, but pasting it into the console should work.
